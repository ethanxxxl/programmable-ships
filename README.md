# Strategy and Tactics for Astronomical Warfare Simulator

abreviated STAWS, and pronounced how it is spelled, this program intends to model space combat
realistically. This project is heavily inspired by both "The Expanse", and "Enders Game"
books/movies/tv series. This edition will be single player only, and will likely be constrained to
two dimensions.
